## Summary

CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) are the way to extend the Kubernetes API to
include custom resource types that behave like the native resource types. CRDs
have been in Beta since Kubernetes 1.7. This document outlines the required
steps to graduate CRDs to general availability (GA).

## Motivation

CRDs are in widespread use as a Kubernetes extensibility mechanism and have been
available in beta for the last 5 Kubernetes releases. Feature requests and bug
reports suggest CRDs are nearing GA quality, and this KEP aims to itemize the
remaining improvements to move this toward GA.

### Goals

Establish consensus for the remaining essential improvements needed to move CRDs to GA.

Guiding principles:
* if a missing feature forces or encourages users to implement non-Kubernetes-like APIs, and therefore damages the ecosystem long term, it belongs on this list.
* If a feature cannot be added as an after-thought of a GA API, it or some preparation belongs on this list.


### Non-Goals

Full feature parity with native kubernetes resource types is not a GA graduation goal. See above guiding principles.

## Proposal

Objectives to graduate CRDs to GA, each of which is described in more detail further below:

* Defaulting and pruning for custom resources is implemented
* CRD v1 schemas are restricted to a subset of the OpenAPI specification (and there is a v1beta1 compatibility plan)
* Generator exists for CRD Validation Schema v3 (Kubebuilder)
* CustomResourceWebhookConversion API is GA ready
* CustomResourceSubresources API is GA ready

Bug fixes required to graduate CRDs to GA:

* See “Required for GA” issues tracked via the [CRD Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/28).

For additional details on already completed features, see the [Umbrella Issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/58682).

See [Post-GA tasks](#post-ga-tasks) for decided out-of-scope features.

### Defaulting and pruning for custom resources is implemented

Both defaulting and pruning and also read-only validation are blocked by the
OpenAPI subset definition (next point). 

See the [Pruning for CustomResources KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/20180731-crd-pruning.md)
and the [Defaulting for Custom Resources KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/20190426-crd-defaulting.md).

### CRD v1 schemas are restricted to a subset of the OpenAPI specification

See [OpenAPI Subset KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/20190425-structural-openapi.md)

### Generator exists for CRD Validation Schema v3 (Kubebuilder)

See [kubebuilder’s
crd-gen](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools/tree/master/cmd/crd)
and a more general
[crd-schema-gen](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools/pull/183),
to be integrated into kubebuidler’s controller-tools.

### CustomResourceWebhookConversion API is GA ready

Currently CRD webhook conversion is alpha. We plan to take this to v1beta1 according to the
[CustomResourceDefinition Conversion Webhook's Graduation Criteria](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/20190425-crd-conversion-webhook.md#graduation-criteria).
We plan to then graduate this to GA as part of the CRD to GA graduation.

### CustomResourceSubresources API is GA ready

Currently custom resource subresources are v1beta1 and provide support for the
/status and /scale subresources. We plan to graduate this to GA as part of the
CRD to GA graduation.

### v1 API

The CRD `v1` API will be the same as the `v1beta1` but with all changes to the API from the GA tasks:

* Rename misnamed json field [JSONPath](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/06bc7e3e0026ea25065f59f4bd305c0b7dbbc145/staging/src/k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apis/apiextensions/v1beta1/types.go#L226-L227) to `jsonPath`
* [Replace top-level fields with per version fields](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/api-machinery/customresource-conversion-webhook.md#top-level-fields-to-per-version-fields)
* Restrict OpenAPI per [Vanilla OpenAPI Subset Design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pcGlbmw-2Y0JJs9hsYnSBXamgG9TfWtHY6eh80zSTd8)

## Test Plan

### Integration tests for GA

TODO: complete this list

* [Pruning for CustomResources KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/709)
  * TODO
* [Vanilla OpenAPI Subset Design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pcGlbmw-2Y0JJs9hsYnSBXamgG9TfWtHY6eh80zSTd8)
  * TODO
* CRD versioning/conversion (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/64136):
  * Ensure what is persisted in etcd matches the storage version
  * Set up a CRD, persist some data, changed the version, and ensure the previously persisted data is readable
  * Ensure discovery docs track a CRD through creation, version addition, version removal, and deletion
  * Ensure `spec.served` is respected

### e2e tests for GA

* Custom Resources should be readable and writable at all available versions (test for round trip-ability)
* A Custom Resource watch should terminate if its CustomResourceDefinition is deleted or updated

### Scale Targets for GA

The scale target for GA of custom resources are defined by the same [API call latency
SLIs/SLOs as the Kuberetes native types](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-scalability/slos/api_call_latency.md#api-call-latency-slisslos-details).

The targets are defined by the below thresholds, which are organized the same way as the [Kubernetes native type thresholds](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-scalability/configs-and-limits/thresholds.md#kubernetes-thresholds), with only a couple changes:

- Since custom resources can be arbitrarily large, we have added a object size column and thresholds for a range of object sizes.
- For clarity, we include thersolds with and without conversion webhooks.

**Custom Resources per Definition, with Conversion webhook:**

| Object size | Threshold scope=namespace | Threshold: scope=cluster |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10kb | 2500 | 12500 |
| 25kb | 1000 | 5000 |
| 50kb | 500 | 2500 |

**Custom Resources per Definition, without Conversion webhook:**

| Object size | Threshold scope=namespace | Threshold: scope=cluster |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10kb | 5000 | 25000 |
| 25kb | 2000 | 10000 |
| 50kb | 1000 | 5000 |

_Note: For `scope: Namespaced` custom resource definitions, the scope=namespace
threshold indicates how many custom resource objects may be in each namespace,
and the scope=cluster threshold indicates how many custom resource objects may
be in the cluster total. For `scope: Cluster` custom resource definitions, only
the scope=cluster threshold applies._

**Custom Resource Definitions:**

| Threshold scope=namespace | Threshold: scope=cluster |
| --- | --- |
| n/a | 500 |

_Note: The Custom Resource Definition threshold was selected not due to the
above SLI/SLOs, but instead due to the latency OpenAPI publishing, which is a
background process that occurs asychroniously each time a Custom Resource
Definition is updated. For 500 Custom Resource Definitions it takes slightly
over 35 seconds for a a definition change to be visible via the OpenAPI schema
endpoint._

_Note: Given that the performance and scalability of conversion webhooks are the
responsibility of their author, CRD scale targets are defined for conversion
webhook latency that includes serialization/deserialization cost, but does not
include the webhook conversion operation cost (i.e. the cost of the custom
authored conversion routines for a particular conversion webhook is not
accounted for)._

GA custom resource scale targets were selected based on an [analysis of our current scale limits](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tEstPQvzGvaRnN-WwGUWx1H9xHPRCy_fFcGlgTkB3f8).

We ran a month long survey of Custom Resource Definition scale needs across Kubernetes mailing lists, slack channels and social media.
Of the custom resource definitions surveyed, 96% are currently within these scale thresholds, 91% are within these thresholds for their anticipated future growth, and survey data provides useful guidance for our post-GA scalability work. See [survey of real-world custom resource usage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MTd_gDlpgBaT5sAKM4j6tQVeCFIT9J44RHzt2yWOK_g) for details.

As part of GA the threshold and SLO documentation will be updated to make this clear and to
encourage CRD authors to provide concrete thresholds/SLOs for their custom
resource kinds to their users that account for the per resource conversion cost
of their conversion webhook and/or size of their custom resources.

## Graduation Criteria

To mark these as complete, all of the above features need to be implemented. An
umbrella issue is tracking all of these changes. Also there need to be
sufficient tests for any of these new features and all existing features and
documentation should be completed for all features.

See [umbrella issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/58682) for status.

## Post-GA tasks
