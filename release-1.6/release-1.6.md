(To Be Approved at Dec 22 1.5 Retrospective Meeting)

#Proposed timeline for 1.6
We will begin the 1.6 release the first week of 2017.
We will use the time between releases for planning, designing and bugfixes.

The proposal below is identical in layout to the 1.4 and 1.5 plans with some
modifications:
- as before, key days aren't Fridays, since it can be hard to end milestones right up against weekends
- some sigs will focus on stabilization for 1.6, and there may be fewer new
  feature proposals
- there are fewer major holidays and vacation breaks this quarter 

##1.6 Overview
- Dec 8 - Jan 3: planning/design/bugfix period
- Jan 3 (Tues) coding start (7w)
- Jan 24 (Tues) features repo freeze
- Feb 20 (Mon) - Feb 24 (Fri) Feature Burndown Meetings
