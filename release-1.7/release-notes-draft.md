## External Dependency Version Information

Continuous integration builds have used the following versions of external dependencies, however, this is not a strong recommendation and users should consult an appropriate installation or upgrade guide before deciding what versions of etcd, docker or rkt to use. 

TODO: this is copy-pasted from release-1.6/release-notes-draft.md, please update for 1.7

* Docker versions 1.10.3, 1.11.2, 1.12.6 have been validated
  * Docker version 1.12.6 known issues
    * overlay2 driver not fully supported
    * live-restore not fully supported 
    * no shared pid namespace support
  * Docker version 1.11.2 known issues
    * Kernel crash with Aufs storage driver on Debian Jessie ([#27885](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/27885))
      which can be identified by the [node problem detector](http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/node-problem/)
    * Leaked File descriptors ([#275](https://github.com/docker/containerd/issues/275))
    * Additional memory overhead per container ([#21737](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/21737))
  * Docker 1.10.3 contains [backports provided by RedHat](https://github.com/docker/docker/compare/v1.10.3...runcom:docker-1.10.3-stable) for known issues
  * Support for Docker version 1.9.x has been removed
* rkt version 1.23.0+
  * known issues with the rkt runtime are [listed in the Getting Started Guide](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/rkt/notes/)
* etcd version 3.0.17

## Process

I started with the release-1.5/release-notes-draft.md file, and removed all content under the existing headings.

I use the following script to start populating the features section
```sh
for sig in $(hub issue -M 6 | sed -e 's|.*sig/\([^ ]*\).*|\1|g' | sort | uniq); do
  echo "- **$sig**"
  for stage in alpha beta stable; do 
    hub issue -M 6 -l sig/$sig,stage/$stage -f \
      "  - [$stage] %t ([kubernetes/features%i](%U))%n";
  done
done
```

I noticed the following sections in the release-1.6/release-notes-draft.md file, but have explicitly left them out here.  Please add back in if you feel they're necessary:
- WARNING: etcd backup strongly recommneded
- Changes to API Resources
- Changes to Major Components
- Changes to Cluster Provisioning Scripts
- Changes to Addons
